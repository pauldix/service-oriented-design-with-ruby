I've updated this code example to work with bundler so specific gem versions can be more easily installed. I've also tested with Ruby 1.9.2p0.

The best way to get on 1.9.2p0 if you aren't already is to use RVM (http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/). Then install bundler with the following:
gem install bundler --version=1.0.7

Then install the gems:
bundle install

Now you'll have to create the database. Do this from the command line:
rake db:migrate

Then you can run the service specs by doing this:
rspec spec/service_spec.rb

Note that you should be using the rspec command. It used to be spec, but with new versions this will throw an error.

You can run the client specs by opening up two terminal windows and putting the two commands in each:
ruby service.rb -p 3000
rspec spec/client_spec.rb

Install RVM:
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

Remove Gemfile.lock: 
rm Gemfile.lock

Install the gems:
bundle install

Migrate the development and test databases:
rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=test
rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=development

Run the service specs:
rspec spec/service_spec.rb

Run the client library specs. In 2 diferent terminals:
ruby service.rb -e test -p 3000
rspec spec/client_spec.rb
